        For example, if your issue is related to syntax highlighting, it is probably related
        to [`duat-treesitter`](https://github.com/AhoyISki/duat-treesitter), not duat.

        If you installed with `--featues git-deps`, try running the `reload --clear` command inside duat.
        That should remove the `~/.config/duat/target`, `~/.local/share/duat` and `~/.cache/duat` directories,
        which should essentially rebuild the latest version of everything, while also removing potentially
        incompatible cache entries. **NOTE** Rebuilding everything may take a little bit of time, so be patient.

        Currently, support for OSX is spotty, and support for Windows is untested and likely not working
        outside of WSL.
