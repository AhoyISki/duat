        For example, if you want something to do with syntax trees, your request should be on
        [`duat-treesitter`](https://github.com/AhoyISki/duat-treesitter), and if you want some
        additional keybindings, you should request that feature on the repository of the `Mode`
        in use ([`duat-kak`](https://github.com/AhoyISki/duat-kak), for example).
      options:
        - label: Yes, it is most closely related to duat.
          required: true
        - label: I also checked, and this was not requested before.

        Does this belong on the core crates of duat? Could it be implemented as a plugin?
        Is it needlesly difficult to implement this as a plugin?
        options:
          - It belongs in duat, I think.
          - It might be implementable as a plugin.
          - I thought about it, and implementing it as a plugin seems too hard.

        If you installed with `--featues git-deps`, try running the `reload --clear` command inside duat.
        That should remove the `~/.config/duat/target`, `~/.local/share/duat` and `~/.cache/duat` directories,
        which should essentially rebuild the latest version of everything, while also removing potentially
        incompatible cache entries. **NOTE** Rebuilding everything may take a little bit of time, so be patient.
