        If you installed with `--featues git-deps`, try running the `reload --clear` command inside duat.
        That should remove the `~/.config/duat/target`, `~/.local/share/duat` and `~/.cache/duat` directories,
        which should essentially rebuild the latest version of everything, while also removing potentially
        incompatible cache entries

        outside of WSL.
