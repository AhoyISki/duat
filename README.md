This plugin is supposed to be a jump list for [`Selections`][__link0]
movements to be used by text editing paradigms like `duat-kak` and
`duat-vim`.

It works by recording the [`Selections`][__link1] and can retrieve previous
`Selections` values, taking [`Change`][__link2]s that took place into
account.
