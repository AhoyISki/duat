FOR NEXT UPDATE:
[ ] Ui coordinates:
  [x] Implementation.
  [ ] Floating widgets.
  [x] Mouse support.
    [x] Widget integration.
    [?] Mode integration.
[ ] Command line completion.
[ ] File path completion.
[ ] Get rid of Text::selections_mut.
[ ] Lazily evaluate height and width, including when pushing and spawning.
[ ] Named StatusParts.
[ ] File tracking.
[ ] Actually fix injected indentation.
[ ] Mode keybindings info.
[x] Move to Rust stable (sigh...).
[ ] Flags parameter macro.
[ ] Abuse the shit out of catch_unwind.

KNOWN BUGS:
 HIGH PRIORITY:
  [ ] track_area not actually tracking correctly.
  [ ] Removing a bunch of injections at the same time seems to freak treesitter out.
  [ ] First Point not updating when there are changes before the start of the screen.
  [ ] Apparently treesitter still ain't working.
             
 LOW PRIORITY:
  [ ] Completions aren't properly sized.
  [ ] Perfect print iterators.
    [ ] Perfect words iterator.
  [ ] tree-sitter-duat-text is not being used.
  [ ] std::mem::replace (grrrr...).
  [ ] Tree-sitter still hangs while loading injected languages, it would be easy to prevent that.
  [ ] For now, on Windows, duat can only reload if there is only one instance open.

FUTURE UPDATES:
[ ] Locking a Mutex on every Change is surely slow.
[ ] Stop eagerly merging Selections.
[ ] Get started on a Vim mode.
[ ] Create a fun lil' spinner.
[ ] OptsParser for the Buffer.
[ ] Named colors.
[ ] Turn the History into a tree.
[ ] Remove requirement of Clone on Modes.
[ ] Get rid of Widget::needs_update?
[ ] Get rid of print function from Widgets, implement LineNumbers through a Parser.
[ ] Coordinates based tagging.
[ ] Use track_caller on TextBuilder.
[ ] Anonymous Forms, which index based on hashing the Form itself.ap
[ ] Add Form interpolation and Form::copy.
[ ] Use Tags for masks.
[ ] Keep information of PushSpecs and SpawnSpecs on the Handles.
[ ] Initial installation configuration menu.
[ ] Print only changed lines.
[ ] Handle mostly utf-8 strings.
[ ] Allow Modes to detect when a key is mapped.
[ ] Add a failure mode for remapping.
[/] Bring back multithreading?
[ ] Additive Forms.
[ ] Remapping on `Mode` creation.
[x] Use the FileCfg insted of OnFileOpen.
[ ] FileBuilder::push_detached!
[ ] ReplaceCell Tags!
[ ] Split suggested max range by conceals.
[ ] A MapForm Tag!
[ ] macro_mode! or something like that.
[ ] Fuzzy path detection should be rule based, not on what buffers are open.
[ ] rustc_on_unimplemented for State.
[ ] Crumple zone tags (?).
[ ] Document print.rs (jesus christ man)
[ ] Custom error messages for unimplemented on status!.
[ ] It is technically possible to reverse iterate without going over the whole line, if you know where in the screen said line ends.
[ ] add options to the build script, about which type of UI you want, and where to get your config files.
[ ] general undo/redo, that can delete/create files.
[ ] ghosts 👻 on doc comments for tests.
[ ] mouse drag binding to resize widgets.
[ ] adaptive widget size.
[ ] transition the ranges system to 4 lists.
[ ] Least common denominator for showing paths.
[ ] An updater function that returns true if a certain hook was triggered.
[ ] File statics.
[ ] No wrapping Tag.
[ ] Search bar widget that shows up when you hover over a tooltip.
[ ] Go to reference should popup a list of references, while swapping the whole screen as you scroll.
[ ] Completion lists should have automatic triggers.
[ ] Compilation should automatically plug plugins.
[ ] Completion/hover panels should allow you to press tab to go to the next element and search for it.
[ ] fixed_file and dyn_file should only call for updates if the File has actually changed at all.
[ ] LSP option to show function arguments only when parenthesis is typed.
[ ] Use the format-like modif to modify forms on the fly.
[ ] `m` key could act on additional pairs if cursor is in specific chars.
[ ] Option to show colored text on the txt! macro.

PERFORMANCE IDEAS:
[ ] Try not iterating over every character in scroll_vertically.
