title: The Duat text editor
---
Duat is a text editor that is built and _configured_ in the Rust programming language. It is meant to be very modular in its design, while still having great defaults for anyone used to TUI and modal text editors.

You should head over to the [Initial setup page](./initial-setup.md) in order to get started with Duat. There'll be quick configuration options, as well as a general overview of how things are done in Duat.
