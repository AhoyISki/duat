# Quick settings

First of all, before you start anything, you should _try_ to become at least 
_somewhat_ accustomed to how rust works as a programming language. If you don't
know **anything** at all, the [rust book] is a great place to start learning.

One of the main aspects that Duat tries to accomplish is an emergent complexity
for its features. That is, the more you learn about Duat, the easier it becomes
to learn new things about it. Every feature should help you understand other
features.

That being said, here are some quick settings, which should hopefully compose
later on to help you better understand duat.
