# Frequently used snippets

If you just want some no nonsense snippets to copy paste into your config, this 
is the chapter for you.

For every snippet, assume that the snippet is placed inside of the `setup` 
function, given the following setup:

```rust
setup_duat!(setup);
use duat::prelude::*;

fn setup() {
    // Here be snippets.
}
```
