# The `prelude` module

At the top of your crate, you should be able to find this:

```rust
setup_duat!(setup);
use duat::prelude::*;

fn setup() {
    // The stuff inside your setup...
}
```

This will import everything in the `prelude` module of `duat`. This should have
everything you will need in order to configure Duat, not including things from
other crates that you may want to import (such as plugins).

When calling `use duat::prelude::*`, most imported things will be in the form 
of modules, like this:

```rust
# use duat::prelude::*;
use duat::print;
```

This is importing the `print` module, as opposed to importing its items 
directly, like this:

```rust
# use duat::prelude::*;
use duat::print::*;
```

This means that, for most options, their path is made up of a 
`{module}::{function}` combo. So the usual `setup` function should look 
something like this:

```rust
# mod duat_kak {
#     use duat::{prelude::{*, mode::KeyEvent}};
#     #[derive(Clone)]
#     pub struct Insert;
#     impl Mode<Ui> for Insert {
#         type Widget = File;
#         fn send_key(&mut self, _: &mut Pass, _: KeyEvent, _: Handle<File>) {
#             todo!();
#         }
#     }
#     #[derive(Default)]
#     pub struct Kak;
#     impl duat_core::Plugin<Ui> for Kak {
#         fn plug(self, _: &duat_core::Plugins<Ui>) {}
#     }
# }
setup_duat!(setup);
use duat::prelude::*;

fn setup() {
    plug(duat_kak::Kak::default());

    print::wrap_at(150);
    print::trailing_new_line('Û±Åê');
    
    form::set("caret.main", Form::yellow());
    
    cmd::add!("set-rel-lines", |pa, ln: cmd::Handles<LineNumbers<Ui>>| {
        ln.on_flags(pa, |pa, handle| {
            handle.write(pa).rel_abs();
        });
        
        Ok(Some(txt!("Lines were set to [a]relative absolute").build()))
    });
    
    map::<duat_kak::Insert>("jk", "<Esc>:w<Enter>");
}
```

The exceptions to this are the `map`, `alias` and `plug` functions, the 
`setup_duat!` macro. These items are imported directly.

The following chapters should give a quick overview of these items imported 
from the prelude module.
