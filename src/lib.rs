//! Duat is a text editor meant to have as much modularity as
//! possible, while keeping a sensible default configuration. It is
//! written _and configured_ in Rust, through the use of a
//! configuration Rust crate, placed in `~/.config/duat/` (or wherever
//! `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set to).
//!
//! When installing Duat, this crate will be automatically placed in
//! that spot, and it will have a default example configuration.
//!
//! When you first run Duat, and whenever you update the
//! configuration, it will be compiled and reloaded automatically, so
//! you can see the changes in *almost* real time. Initially, building
//! Duat and its configuration crate might take a while. But while
//! reloading Duat, in my (somewhat old) computer, it takes ~0.7 (for
//! small changes) to ~2.3 seconds (for bigger changes) to reload
//! the config.
//!
//! Note that this is an alpha project, so there may be some quirks
//! and bugs. So if you have a problem, or something seems confusing,
//! feel free to ask questions or raise an issue, that would be very
//! welcome ðŸ¥°.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! > [!NOTE]
//! >
//! > On this section, I will be referring to duat's configuration by
//! > `~/.config/duat/`, but you should replace that with that of your
//! > operating system.
//!
//! To install Duat, I am assuming that you have `cargo` installed on
//! your system, if you don't, [install it].
//!
//! After installing `cargo`, you will also need to install the
//! `nightly` toolchain:
//!
//! ### On unix-like operating systems
//!
//! ```bash
//! rustup install nightly
//! ```
//!
//! ### On Windows
//!
//! ```bash
//! rustup install nightly-x86_64-pc-windows-gnu
//! ```
//!
//! To install Duat, another dependency that you will need is `gcc`.
//! On unix-like operating systems, that should already be installed.
//! But on Windows (of course) you need to (very) manually install it.
//! You can follow the instructions on [this guide] in order to do
//! that. You can skip the prerequesits section, it's vscode specific.
//!
//! Next, in order to run duat, you should add `~/.cargo/bin/` to your
//! `$PATH` variable. Alternatively, you can just add
//! `~/.cargo/bin/duat`, if you want to add just `duat` to the
//! `$PATH`. Now, you can install duat:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo install duat
//! ```
//!
//! Although, since this is an alpha, I would recommend the git
//! version, since that is kept much  more up to date:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo install --git https://github.com/AhoyISki/duat --force --features git-deps
//! ```
//!
//! And if you want to nuke your config in order to get the newest
//! default config crate, you can do the following:
//!
//! ```bash
//! rm -rf ~/.config/duat
//! cargo install --git https://github.com/AhoyISki/duat --force --features git-deps
//! ```
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! In the configuration file, there should be a `setup_duat!` macro,
//! which takes in a function with no parameters.
//!
//! This function is the setup for duat, and it can be empty, which is
//! the equivalent of the default configuration for Duat.
//!
//! Here's an example configuration file, which makes use of the
//! `duat-kak` crate, which is a plugin for Duat. This plugin, like
//! all others, is included without the `duat_` prefix, so in the
//! config it is just `kak`.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # mod kak {
//! #     use duat::{prelude::{*, mode::KeyEvent}};
//! #     #[derive(Clone)]
//! #     pub struct Normal;
//! #     impl Mode<Ui> for Normal {
//! #         type Widget = File;
//! #         fn send_key(&mut self, _: &mut Pass, _: KeyEvent, _: Handle<File>) {
//! #             todo!();
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! #     #[derive(Clone)]
//! #     pub struct Insert;
//! #     impl Mode<Ui> for Insert {
//! #         type Widget = File;
//! #         fn send_key(&mut self, _: &mut Pass, _: KeyEvent, _: Handle<File>) {
//! #             todo!();
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! #     pub struct Kak;
//! #     impl Kak {
//! #         pub fn new() -> Self { Self }
//! #     }
//! #     impl duat_core::Plugin<Ui> for Kak {
//! #         fn plug(self, _: &duat_core::Plugins<Ui>) {}
//! #     }
//! # }
//! setup_duat!(setup);
//! use duat::prelude::*;
//!
//! fn setup() {
//!     plug(kak::Kak::new());
//!     map::<kak::Insert>("jk", "<Esc>");
//!
//!     print::wrap_on_edge();
//!
//!     hook::add::<LineNumbers<Ui>>(|pa, (cfg, _)| cfg.align_right());
//!
//!     hook::add::<StatusLine<Ui>>(|pa, (cfg, _)| {
//!         let upper_mode = mode_name(pa).map(pa, |m| match m.split_once('<') {
//!             Some((no_generics, _)) => no_generics.to_uppercase(),
//!             None => m.to_uppercase(),
//!         });
//!         cfg.fmt(status!(
//!             "[Mode]{upper_mode}{Spacer}{name_txt} {sels_txt} {main_txt}"
//!         ))
//!     });
//!
//!     hook::add::<ModeSwitched>(|_, (_, new)| match new {
//!         "Insert" => cursor::set_main(CursorShape::SteadyBar),
//!         _ => cursor::unset(),
//!     });
//!
//!     form::set("Mode", Form::dark_magenta());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This configuration does the following things:
//!
//! - [plugs] the `Kak` plugin, which changes the [default mode];
//! - [Maps] jk to esc in the `Insert` mode;
//! - [Changes] the wrapping;
//! - Changes the alignment of the [`LineNumbers`] [`Widget`];
//! - [Removes] the hook group "FooterWidgets";
//! - Changes the [status line] (with a [Spacer] for 2 separate sides,
//!   and a reformatted [`mode_name`]);
//! - [Adds] hooks for [mode changes] in Duat, which change the shape
//!   of the cursor;
//! - [Changes](form::set) the [style] of the mode printed on the
//!   status line;
//!
//! These are only some of the options available to configure Duat,
//! you can also add [custom commands], place widgets around other
//! [`Widget`](crate::hook::WidgetCreated)s and [windows], create
//! [`Parser`]s that can track every change on a [`File`], and many
//! other things.
//!
//! Duat also comes with a fully fledged [text creation system], which
//! significantly eases the creation of widgets:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use duat::prelude::*;
//! # fn test() {
//! let text = txt!("[my_form]Waow it's my form![]not anymore ðŸ˜¢").build();
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, I'm using the "my_form" form in order to style
//! the text, while `[]` reverts back to the "default" form. Double
//! `[[` and `]]` escape the `[` and `]`, just like `{{` and `}}` in
//! [`println!`]. The [`status!`] macro works similarly.
//!
//! # Troubleshooting
//!
//! These issues asume that you are working with the `--git-deps`
//! version of `duat`
//!
//! ## The configuration fails to compile/recompile
//!
//! Try running this in `~/.config/duat`:
//!
//! ```bash
//! cargo clean && cargo update && cargo build --release
//! ```
//!
//! This could solve inconsistencies in the API, given that it could
//! change without the plugins being aware of those changes.
//!
//! ## It still fails to compile!
//!
//! In this case, you should open an issue with the error message that
//! `cargo build --release` sent you.
//!
//! ## It's still segfaulting as I reopen!
//!
//! This is an indication that your installed version of duat became
//! incompatible with that of your config. Rerun the installation
//! process, no need to remove `~/.config/duat`.
//!
//! ## It's still segfaulting!
//!
//! In that case open an issue
//!
//! # Default plugins
//!
//! When you install duat, the default config crate will come with
//! some preinstalled plugins:
//!
//! - [`duat-kak`] is a plugin that changes the default mode of Duat
//!   to one inspired by [Kakoune]'s "Normal", also bringing with it
//!   various other modes from Kakoune.
//! - [`duat-catppuccin`] is a just a simple colorscheme plugin, it
//!   adds the four flavors from the [catppuccin] colorscheme. You can
//!   pick between the four of them, you can apply its colors to other
//!   [`Form`]s and you can allow or disallow the colorscheme to set
//!   the background color.
//! - [`duat-treesitter`] brings [tree-sitter] to Duat in the form of
//!   syntax highlighting and indentation calculation, which can be
//!   used by Modes (such as those from `duat-kak`) in order to give
//!   better feedback when editing files.
//!
//! You can, of course, unplug these by not calling [`plug!`], or you
//! could remove them entirely by taking them out of the
//! `Cargo.toml`'s [dependencies section].
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! Duat provides a lot of features, trying to be as configurable as
//! possible, here are some of the things that Duat is capable of:
//!
//! - Completely custom modes, with full Vim style remapping;
//! - Completely custom widgets, with user created modes;
//! - Arbitrary concealment of text, and arbitrary ghost text;
//! - Custom hooks, whose activation is up to the creator;
//! - Custom commands, with customizable parameters supported by;
//!   Rust's robust type system;
//! - Multi UI adaptability, although for now, only a terminal UI has
//!   been made;
//! - And many others still being planned;
//!
//! Additionally, by choosing Rust as its configuration language, Duat
//! also gains the following features:
//!
//! - Complete type safety;
//! - A very functional programming language, with lots of native
//!   features;
//! - Cargo is the plugin manager;
//!
//! ## Roadmap
//!
//! These are the goals that have been accomplished or are on their
//! way:
//!
//! - [x] Implement basic visual functionality (printing, scrolling,
//!   etc);
//! - [x] Implement wrapping;
//! - [x] Implement editing;
//! - [x] Create a kak mode;
//! - [x] Implement the use of multiple cursors;
//! - [x] Implement a history system;
//! - [x] Implement colors;
//! - [x] Implement widgets and designated areas;
//! - [x] Make all of these things easy to use on a public interface;
//! - [x] Create a number line and a separator line;
//! - [x] Create a status line;
//! - [x] File switching;
//! - [x] Create a command creation interface and a command line;
//! - [x] Add the ability to frame areas;
//! - [x] Implement concealment;
//! - [x] Implement hot reloading of configuration;
//! - [x] Create a "normal editing" mode;
//! - [x] Add the ability to create hooks;
//! - [x] Create a more generalized plugin system;
//! - [x] Implement incremental Regex searching;
//! - [x] Implement tree-sitter;
//! - [ ] Add floating widgets, not tied to the session layout;
//! - [ ] Implement autocompletion lists;
//! - [ ] Create an LSP plugin;
//! - [ ] Create a vim mode;
//!
//! ï¸™
//!
//! - [ ] Create an Iced frontend;
//!
//! __NOTE:__ These are not set in stone, and may be done out of
//! order.
//!
//! ## Why should I use this?
//!
//! I don't know what your personal reasoning would be, but in my
//! case, I really like Kakoune's editing model, but was frustrated
//! with the lack of some features, like folding, multiple file
//! editing, the general barebonesness of the configuration, etc.
//!
//! I know that Neovim has all of these features, and Helix supposedly
//! tries to solve some of these issues. But I don't really like
//! either of their editing styles to be honest.
//!
//! And so I thought, why not make my own text editor?
//!
//! I thought, why not make a text editor that is as modular as
//! possible, while still having a sensible default configuration?
//! That I could modify however I wanted, and with a language that I
//! love?
//!
//! That's why I decided to create Duat.
//!
//! ## Why the name
//!
//! idk, cool sounding word that I got from Spelunky 2.
//!
//! Also, just wanted to say that no AI was used in this project, cuz
//! I don't like it.

pub mod hook {
    //! Utilities for hooks in Duat
    //!
    //! In Duat, hooks are handled through the [`Hookable`] trait.
    //! This trait contains the [`Hookable::Input`] associated
    //! type, which is what should be passed to hooks on the
    //! specific [`Hookable`]. By implementing this trait, you
    //! allow an end user to hook executions whenever said
    //! [`Hookable`] is triggered:
    //!
    //! ```rust
    //! setup_duat!(setup);
    //! use duat::prelude::*;
    //!
    //! fn setup() {
    //!     hook::add::<LineNumbers<Ui>>(|pa, (line_nums, _)| {
    //!         line_nums.align_right().align_main_left().rel_abs()
    //!     });
    //! }
    //! ```
    //!
    //! The [hook above] makes it so that, whenever [`LineNumbers`]
    //! are created, they main number is absolute and shifts left,
    //! while other numbers are relative and shift right. This
    //! hook gives you the power to configure any [`Widget`] that
    //! gets created, but what if you want to add more widgets?
    //!
    //! ```rust
    //! setup_duat!(setup);
    //! use duat::prelude::*;
    //!
    //! fn setup() {
    //!     hook::add::<File>(|_, (cfg, builder)| {
    //!         builder.push(status!("{name_txt} {main_txt}").above());
    //!         cfg
    //!     });
    //! }
    //! ```
    //!
    //! [That hook] lets you push more [`Widget`]s to a [`File`],
    //! whenever one is opened. In this case, I'm pushing a
    //! [`StatusLine`] on top of the [`File`], which displays the
    //! [file's name], as well as its [main `Selection`].
    //!
    //! Do note that this won't be the only [`Widget`] that will be
    //! pushed around the [`File`], since there are some predefined
    //! [hook groups] in Duat.
    //!
    //! From the `cfg` argument, you can also change settings on that
    //! [`File`], in a similar vein to the [`print`](crate::print)
    //! module:
    //!
    //! ```rust
    //! setup_duat!(setup);
    //! use duat::prelude::*;
    //!
    //! fn setup() {
    //!     hook::add::<File>(|_, (mut cfg, _)| {
    //!         if let Some("yaml" | "json") = cfg.filetype() {
    //!             cfg.tabstop(2)
    //!         } else {
    //!             cfg
    //!         }
    //!     });
    //! }
    //! ```
    //!
    //! The hook above will change the [tabstop] value to `2` on
    //! `"yaml"` and `"json"` files.
    //!
    //! # Default hook groups
    //!
    //! Hook groups are essentially "removable hooks", that are
    //! predefined in order to give a more complete, yet customizable
    //! default experience for Duat:
    //!
    //! ```rust
    //! setup_duat!(setup);
    //! use std::sync::atomic::{AtomicUsize, Ordering};
    //!
    //! use duat::prelude::*;
    //!
    //! fn setup() {
    //!     static KEY_COUNT: AtomicUsize = AtomicUsize::new(0);
    //!
    //!     hook::add_grouped::<KeysSent>("CountKeys", |pa, keys| {
    //!         KEY_COUNT.fetch_add(keys.len(), Ordering::Relaxed);
    //!     });
    //! }
    //! ```
    //!
    //! These are the default [hook groups]:
    //!
    //! - `"FileWidgets"`: Pushes a [`VertRule`] and [`LineNumbers`]
    //!   to new [`File`]s, via [`WidgetCreated`], (using [`File`] as
    //!   an alias for [`WidgetCreated<File>`]).
    //! - `"FooterWidgets"`: Pushes a  [`StatusLine`], [`PromptLine`]
    //!   and [`Notifications`] to new windows, via [`WindowCreated`].
    //! - `"HidePromptLine"`: Is responsible for [hiding] the
    //!   [`PromptLine`] when it is not in use, giving way to the
    //!   [`Notifications`], via [`FocusedOn`] and [`UnfocusedFrom`].
    //! - `"ReloadOnWrite"`: Reloads the `config` crate whenever any
    //!   file in it is written to, via [`FileWritten`].
    //!
    //! # Available hooks
    //!
    //! Currently, these are the existing hooks in `duat-core` and
    //! `duat-utils`:
    //!
    //! - [`ConfigLoaded`] triggers after loading the config crate.
    //! - [`ConfigUnloaded`] triggers after unloading the config
    //!   crate.
    //! - [`ExitedDuat`] triggers after Duat has exited.
    //! - [`WidgetCreated`] triggers when a [`Widget`]'s [cfg] is
    //!   created, letting you change it, the [`Widget`] can be used
    //!   as its [alias]
    //! - [`WindowCreated`], which lets you push widgets around the
    //!   window.
    //! - [`FocusedOn`] lets you act on a [`Widget`] when focused.
    //! - [`UnfocusedFrom`] lets you act on a [`Widget`] when
    //!   unfocused.
    //! - [`KeysSent`] lets you act on a [`dyn Widget`], given a[key].
    //! - [`KeysSentTo`] lets you act on a given [`Widget`], given a
    //!   [key].
    //! - [`FormSet`] triggers whenever a [`Form`] is added/altered.
    //! - [`ModeSwitched`] triggers when you change [`Mode`].
    //! - [`ModeCreated`] lets you act on a [`Mode`] after switching.
    //! - [`FileWritten`] triggers after the [`File`] is written.
    //! - [`SearchPerformed`] (from duat-utils) triggers after a
    //!   search is performed.
    //! - [`SearchUpdated`] (from duat-utils) triggers after a search
    //!   updates.
