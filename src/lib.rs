//! Duat is a text editor built with extensibility and performance in
//! mind, while still having very sensible defaults. It is configured
//! in Rust, by use of a crate. The choice of Rust for configuration
//! grants several benefits:
//!
//! * Safe code by default;
//! * Top quality code checking through rust-analyzer;
//! * Cargo is the plugin manager;
//! * The vast expressiveness of the Rust type system;
//! * Rust is just a fun language to code in;
//!
//! The use of Rust, to some, may seem like a mistake, since it is not
//! a "beginner friendly language", but Duat is developed with ease of
//! configuration in mind, so an average configuration file won't be
//! as verbose as a lot of Rust code, while maintaining good levels of
//! readability:
//!
//! ```rust,ignore
//! use duat::prelude::*;
//! use duat_kak::{KeyMap, Mode, OnModeChange};
//!
//! run! {
//!     print::wrap_on_width();
//!
//!     hooks::remove_group("FileWidgets");
//!     hooks::add::<OnFileOpen>(|builder| {
//!         builder.push::<VertRule>();
//!         builder.push::<LineNumbers>();
//!     });
//!
//!     hooks::remove_group("WindowWidgets");
//!     hooks::add::<OnWindowOpen>(|builder| {
//!         let status = status!(
//!             [File] { File::name } " "
//!             { KeyMap::mode_fmt } " "
//!             selections_fmt " " main_fmt
//!         );
//!
//!         let (child, _) = builder.push_cfg(status);
//!         builder.push_cfg_to(CommandLine::cfg().left_with_percent(30), child);
//!     });
//!
//!     input::set(KeyMap::new());
//!
//!     hooks::add::<OnModeChange>(|(_, new)| match new {
//!         Mode::Insert => cursor::set_main(CursorShape::SteadyBar),
//!         _ => cursor::set_main(CursorShape::SteadyBlock)
//!     });
//!
//!     forms::set("Mode", Form::new().dark_magenta());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This configuration does the following things:
//!
//! - Changes the wrapping;
//! - Removes the hook group "FileWidgets";
//! - Pushes a vertical rule and line numbers to every file;
//! - Removes the hook group "WindowWidgets";
//! - Pushes a status line and command line to the bottom of the
//!   screen;
//! - Changes the input method to a Kakoune inspired duat-kak;
//! - Adds hooks for mode changes in said input method;
//! - Changes the style of the mode printed on the status line;
//!
//! These are some of the configurations available for usage in Duat,
//! and one might perceive how these can be tinkered with to change a
//! lot of things within Duat. For example, the usage of hooks to push
//! widgets to files means that you could do this:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use crate::prelude::*;
//! hooks::add::<OnFileOpen>(|builder| {
//!     builder.push::<VertRule>();
//!     builder.push::<LineNumbers>();
//!     builder.push_cfg(LineNumbers::cfg().on_the_right());
//!     builder.push_cfg(LineNumbers::cfg().on_the_right());
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Now, every file will open with two lines of numbers, one on each
//! side. Would you ever want to do this? ...No, not really, but it
//! shows how configurable Duat can be.
//!
//! Duat also comes with a fully fledged text styling system, which
//! significantly eases the creation of widgets:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use crate::prelude::*
//! let styled text = text!([MyForm] "Waow it's my text" [] "not anymore ðŸ˜¢");
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, I'm using the "MyForm" form in order to style the
//! text, while `[]` reverts back to the "Default" form.
//!
//! With the [tags] provided by Duat, you can also change the
//! alignment, conceal text, add ghost text that can't be interacted
//! with, and also add buttons that take mouse input (in the future).
//! These other tags are particularly useful when one wants to style
//! the file, where multiple plugins may insert tags that do not
//! interact with eachother.
//!
//! Duat also has a simple command system, that lets you add commands
//! with arguments supported by Rust's type system:
//! ```rust
//! # use crate::prelude;
//! let callers = ["collapse-command-line", "ccl"];
//! commands::add_for_widget::<CommandLine>(callers, |command_line, area| {
//!     area.change_constraintk
//! })
//! ```
//!
//! [tags]: duat_core::text::tags
