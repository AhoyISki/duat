//! Duat is a text editor meant to have as much modularity as
//! possible, while keeping a sensible default configuration. It is
//! written _and configured_ in Rust, through the use of a
//! configuration Rust crate, placed in `~/.config/duat/` (or wherever
//! `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME` is set to).
//!
//! When installing Duat, this crate will be automatically placed in
//! that spot, and it will have a default example configuration.
//!
//! When you first run Duat, and whenever you update the
//! configuration, it will be compiled and reloaded automatically, so
//! you can see the changes in *almost* real time. Initially, building
//! Duat and its configuration crate might take a few minutes. And the
//! first reload might also take a similar amount of time. But
//! whenever you make new changes, the next reloads should take only
//! about a second (for debug profile) and ~3 seconds (for release
//! profile).
//!
//! Note that this is an alpha project, so there may be some quirks
//! and bugs. So if you have a problem, or something seems confusing,
//! feel free to ask questions or raise an issue, that would be very
//! welcome ðŸ¥°.
//!
//! ## Getting started
//!
//! To install Duat, do the following:
//!
//! ```text
//! cargo install duat
//! ```
//!
//! Although, since this is an alpha, I would recommend the git
//! version, since that is kept much  more up to date:
//!
//! ```text
//! git clone https://github.com/AhoyISki/duat
//! cargo install --path duat --features git-deps
//! ```
//!
//! And if you want to nuke your config in order to get the newest
//! default config crate, you can do the following:
//!
//! ```text
//! rm -rf ~/.config/duat
//! git clone https://github.com/AhoyISki/duat
//! cargo install --path duat --features git-deps
//! ```
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! In the configuration file, there should be a `setup_duat!` macro,
//! which takes in a function with no parameters.
//!
//! This function is the setup for duat, and it can be empty, which is
//! the equivalent of the default configuration for Duat.
//!
//! Here's an example configuration file, which makes use of the
//! `duat-kak` crate, which is a plugin for Duat. This plugin, like
//! all others, is included without the `duat_` prefix, so in the
//! config it is just `kak`.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # mod treesitter {
//! #     pub struct TreeSitter;
//! #     impl duat_core::Plugin<duat::Ui> for TreeSitter {
//! #         fn new() -> Self {
//! #             Self
//! #         }
//! #         fn plug(self) {}
//! #     }
//! # }
//! # mod kak {
//! #     use duat::{prelude::mode::*, Area, Ui, widgets::File};
//! #     #[derive(Clone)]
//! #     pub struct Normal;
//! #     impl Mode<Ui> for Normal {
//! #         type Widget = File;
//! #         fn send_key(&mut self, _: KeyEvent, _: &mut File, _: &Area) {
//! #             todo!();
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! #     #[derive(Clone)]
//! #     pub struct Insert;
//! #     impl Mode<Ui> for Insert {
//! #         type Widget = File;
//! #         fn send_key(&mut self, _: KeyEvent, _: &mut File, _: &Area) {
//! #             todo!();
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! #     pub struct Kak;
//! #     impl duat_core::Plugin<Ui> for Kak {
//! #         fn new() -> Self {
//! #             Self
//! #         }
//! #         fn plug(self) {}
//! #     }
//! # }
//! setup_duat!(setup);
//! use duat::prelude::*;
//! use kak::{Insert, Normal};
//!
//! fn setup() {
//!     plug!(
//!         treesitter::TreeSitter::new(),
//!         kak::Kak::new()
//!     );
//!     map::<Insert>("jk", "<Esc>");
//!
//!     print::wrap_on_width();
//!
//!     hooks::remove("FileWidgets");
//!     hooks::add::<OnFileOpen>(|builder| {
//!         builder.push(VertRule::cfg());
//!         builder.push(LineNumbers::cfg());
//!     });
//!
//!     hooks::remove("WindowWidgets");
//!     hooks::add::<OnWindowOpen>(|builder| {
//!         let upper_mode = mode_name().map(|m| match m.split_once('<') {
//!             Some((no_generics, _)) => no_generics.to_uppercase(),
//!             None => m.to_uppercase(),
//!         });
//!         let status_line = status!(
//!             [Mode] upper_mode Spacer file_fmt " " selections_fmt " " main_fmt
//!         );
//!
//!         builder.push(status_line);
//!         let (child, _) = builder.push(PromptLine::cfg());
//!         builder.push_to(child, Notifier::cfg());
//!     });
//!
//!     hooks::add::<ModeSwitched>(|(_, new)| match new {
//!         "Insert" => cursor::set_main(CursorShape::SteadyBar),
//!         _ => cursor::set_main(CursorShape::SteadyBlock)
//!     });
//!
//!     form::set("Mode", Form::dark_magenta());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This configuration does the following things:
//!
//! - [plugs] the `Kak` plugin, which changes the [default mode], and
//!   the `TreeSitter` plugin, which adds syntax highlighting and is
//!   also used by the `Kak` plugin;
//! - [Maps] jk to esc in the `Insert` mode;
//! - [Changes] the wrapping;
//! - [Removes] the hook [group] "FileWidgets";
//! - [Pushes] a [vertical rule] and [line numbers] to every file;
//! - [Removes] the hook group "WindowWidgets";
//! - Pushes a [custom status line] (with a [Spacer] for 2 separate
//!   sides, and a reformatted [`mode_name`]), a [command line], and a
//!   [notifications widget] to the bottom of the screen;
//! - [Adds] hooks for [mode changes] in Duat;
//! - [Changes](form::set) the [style] of the mode printed on the
//!   status line;
//!
//! These are some of the ways you can configure Duat. You might
//! notice some things that can be done with these simple options:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use duat::prelude::*;
//! hooks::add::<OnFileOpen>(|builder| {
//!     builder.push(VertRule::cfg());
//!     builder.push(LineNumbers::cfg());
//!     builder.push(VertRule::cfg().on_the_right());
//!     builder.push(LineNumbers::cfg().on_the_right());
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Now, every file will open with two lines of numbers, one on each
//! side. Would you ever want to do this? ...No, not really, but it
//! shows how configurable Duat can be.
//!
//! Duat also comes with a fully fledged [text creation system], which
//! significantly eases the creation of widgets:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use duat::prelude::*;
//! let text = text!([MyForm] "Waow it's my form!" [] " not anymore ðŸ˜¢");
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, I'm using the "MyForm" form in order to style the
//! text, while `[]` reverts back to the "Default" form. The
//! [`status!`] macro works similarly.
//!
//! Duat also has a simple command system, that lets you add commands
//! with arguments supported by Rust's type system. As an example,
//! this command will change the [numbering] of a [`LineNumbers`]
//! widget, switching between absolute and relative numbering.
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use duat::prelude::*;
//! # fn test() -> Result<(), Text> {
//! let callers = ["toggle-relative", "tr"];
//! cmd::add_for!(callers, |line_numbers: LineNumbers<Ui>, _: Area| {
//!     let opts = line_numbers.options_mut();
//!     opts.num_rel = match opts.num_rel {
//!         LineNum::Abs => LineNum::RelAbs,
//!         LineNum::Rel | LineNum::RelAbs => LineNum::Abs,
//!     };
//!     Ok(None)
//! })
//! # }
//! ```
//! # Default plugins
//!
//! When you install duat, the default config crate will come with
//! some preinstalled plugins:
//!
//! - [`duat-kak`] is a plugin that changes the default mode of Duat
//!   to one inspired by [Kakoune]'s "Normal", also bringing with it
//!   various other modes from Kakoune.
//! - [`duat-catppuccin`] is a just a simple colorscheme plugin, it
//!   adds the four flavors from the [catppuccin] colorscheme. You can
//!   pick between the four of them, you can apply its colors to other
//!   [`Form`]s and you can allow or disallow the colorscheme to set
//!   the background color.
//! - [`duat-treesitter`] brings [tree-sitter] to Duat in the form of
//!   syntax highlighting and indentation calculation, which can be
//!   used by Modes (such as those from `duat-kak`) in order to give
//!   better feedback when editing files.
//!
//! You can, of course, unplug these by not calling [`plug!`], or you
//! could remove them entirely by taking them out of the
//! `Cargo.toml`'s [dependencies section].
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! Duat provides a lot of features, trying to be as configurable as
//! possible, here are some of the things that Duat is capable of:
//!
//! - Completely custom modes, with full Vim style remapping
//! - Completely custom widgets, with user created modes
//! - Arbitrary concealment of text, and arbitrary ghost text
//! - Custom hooks, whose activation is up to the creator
//! - Custom commands, with customizable parameters supported by
//!   Rust's robust type system
//! - Multi UI adaptability, although for now, only a terminal UI has
//!   been made
//! - And many others still being planned
//!
//! Additionally, by choosing Rust as its configuration language, Duat
//! also gains the following features:
//!
//! - Complete type safety
//! - A very functional programming language, with lots of native
//!   features
//! - Cargo is the plugin manager
//!
//! ## Roadmap
//!
//! These are the goals that have been accomplished or are on their
//! way:
//!
//! - [x] Implement basic visual functionality (printing, scrolling,
//!   etc);
//! - [x] Implement wrapping;
//! - [x] Implement editing;
//! - [x] Create a kak mode;
//! - [x] Implement the use of multiple cursors;
//! - [x] Implement a history system;
//! - [x] Implement colors;
//! - [x] Implement widgets and designated areas;
//! - [x] Make all of these things easy to use on a public interface;
//! - [x] Create a number line and a separator line;
//! - [x] Create a status line;
//! - [x] File switching;
//! - [x] Create a command creation interface and a command line;
//! - [x] Add the ability to frame areas;
//! - [x] Implement concealment;
//! - [x] Implement hot reloading of configuration;
//! - [x] Create a "normal editing" mode;
//! - [x] Add the ability to create hooks;
//! - [x] Create a more generalized plugin system;
//! - [x] Implement incremental Regex searching;
//! - [x] Implement tree-sitter;
//! - [ ] Add floating widgets, not tied to the session layout;
//! - [ ] Implement autocompletion lists;
//! - [ ] Create an LSP plugin;
//! - [ ] Create a vim mode;
//!
//! ï¸™
//!
//! - [ ] Create an Iced frontend;
//!
//! __NOTE:__ These are not set in stone, and may be done out of
//! order.
//!
//! ## Why should I use this?
//!
//! I don't know what your personal reasoning would be, but in my
//! case, I really like Kakoune's editing model, but was frustrated
//! with the lack of some features, like folding, multiple file
//! editing, the general barebonesness of the configuration, etc.
//!
//! I know that Neovim has all of these features, and Helix supposedly
//! tries to solve some of these issues. But I don't really like
//! either of their editing styles to be honest.
//!
//! And so I thought, why not make my own text editor?
//!
//! I thought, why not make a text editor that is as modular as
//! possible, while still having a sensible default configuration?
//! That I could modify however I wanted, and with a language that I
//! love?
//!
//! That's why I decided to create Duat.
//!
//! ## Why the name
//!
//! idk, cool sounding word that I got from Spelunky 2.
//!
//! Also, just wanted to say that no AI was used in this project, cuz
//! I don't like it.
