//! # Duat
//!
//! Duat is a text editor with Rust as its configuration language. It
//! makes use of a configuration crate in the user's `~/.config`
//! directory. This configuration crate works just like a regular Rust
//! crate, but it is dynamically loaded by Duat and executed on
//! startup.
//!
//! When installed, Duat will be able to automatically detect changes
//! in the user's configuration, adapting to them automatically, with
//! a very short delay.
//!
//! ## Features
//!
//! Duat provides a lot of features, trying to be as configurable as
//! possible, here are some of the things that Duat is capable of:
//!
//! - Completely custom input methods, with full Vim style remapping
//! - Completely custom widgets, with user created input methods
//! - Arbitrary concealment of text, and arbitrary ghost text
//! - Custom hooks, whose activation is up to the creator
//! - Multi UI adaptability, although for now, only a terminal UI has
//!   been made
//! - And many others still being planned
//!
//! Additionaly, by choosing Rust as its configuration language, Duat
//! also gains the following features:
//!
//! - Complete type safety
//! - A very functional programming language, with lots of native
//!   features
//! - Cargo is the plugin manager
//!
//! ## How to use
//!
//! In order to use it, you must have `cargo` installed. If you do,
//! run
//!
//! `cargo install duat`
//!
//! This will install the default version of Duat, which uses a
//! terminal user interface. It will also create a configuration
//! directory in `$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/duat/` or `~/.config/duat/`. This
//! config will have some default changes, but you can modify it as
//! you wish. It also has some documentation explaining the basics of
//! Duat.
//!
//! For now, it has a barebones configuration, which is based on
//! Kakoune, so if you are familiar with that text editor, many of the
//! commands are going to be the same.
//!
//! ## Configuration
//!
//! In the configuration file, there should be a `setup_duat!` macro.
//! This macro takes in a function pointer and executes it as setup
//! for Duat.
//!
//! Here's an example configuration file, which makes use of
//! `duat-kak`
//!
//! ```rust
//! # mod duat_kak {
//! #     use duat::{prelude::{mode::*, data::RwData}, Area, Ui, widgets::File};
//! #     #[derive(Clone)]
//! #     pub struct Normal;
//! #     impl Mode<Ui> for Normal {
//! #         type Widget = File;
//! #         fn send_key(
//! #             &mut self,
//! #             key: KeyEvent,
//! #             widget: &RwData<File>,
//! #             area: &Area,
//! #             cursors: Option<Cursors>,
//! #         ) -> Option<Cursors> {
//! #             todo!();
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! #     #[derive(Clone)]
//! #     pub struct Insert;
//! #     impl Mode<Ui> for Insert {
//! #         type Widget = File;
//! #         fn send_key(
//! #             &mut self,
//! #             key: KeyEvent,
//! #             widget: &RwData<File>,
//! #             area: &Area,
//! #             cursors: Option<Cursors>,
//! #         ) -> Option<Cursors> {
//! #             todo!();
//! #         }
//! #     }
//! # }
//! setup_duat!(setup);
//! use duat::prelude::*;
//! use duat_kak::{Insert, Normal};
//!
//! fn setup() {
//!     mode::set_default(Normal);
//!     map::<Insert>(keys!("jk"), keys!(Esc));
//!
//!     print::wrap_on_width();
//!
//!     hooks::remove("FileWidgets");
//!     hooks::add::<OnFileOpen>(|builder| {
//!         builder.push(VertRule::cfg());
//!         builder.push(LineNumbers::cfg());
//!     });
//!
//!     hooks::remove("WindowWidgets");
//!     hooks::add::<OnWindowOpen>(|builder| {
//!         let status = status!(
//!             [File] { File::name } " "
//!             mode " " selections_fmt " " main_fmt
//!         );
//!
//!         let (child, _) = builder.push(status);
//!         builder.push_to(CommandLine::cfg().left_ratioed(3, 7), child);
//!     });
//!
//!     hooks::add::<ModeSwitched>(|&(_, new)| match new {
//!         "Insert" => cursor::set_main(CursorShape::SteadyBar),
//!         _ => cursor::set_main(CursorShape::SteadyBlock)
//!     });
//!
//!     forms::set("Mode", Form::dark_magenta());
//! }
//! ```
//!
//! This configuration does the following things:
//!
//! - Changes the [default mode] to a Kakoune inspired `Normal`;
//! - [Maps] jk to [esc];
//! - [Changes] the wrapping;
//! - [Removes] the hook [group] "FileWidgets";
//! - [Pushes] a [vertical rule] and [line numbers] to every file;
//! - Removes the hook group "WindowWidgets";
//! - Pushes a [custom status line] and [command line] to the bottom
//!   of the screen;
//! - [Adds] hooks for [mode changes] in Duat;
//! - [Changes](forms::set) the [style] of the mode printed on the
//!   status line;
//!
//! These are some of the ways you can configure Duat. You might
//! notice some things that can be done with these simle options:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use duat::prelude::*;
//! hooks::add::<OnFileOpen>(|builder| {
//!     builder.push(LineNumbers::cfg());
//!     builder.push(LineNumbers::cfg());
//!     builder.push(LineNumbers::cfg().on_the_right());
//!     builder.push(LineNumbers::cfg().on_the_right());
//! });
//! ```
//!
//! Now, every file will open with two lines of numbers, one on each
//! side. Would you ever want to do this? ...No, not really, but it
//! shows how configurable Duat can be.
//!
//! Duat also comes with a fully fledged text styling system, which
//! significantly eases the creation of widgets:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use duat::prelude::*;
//! let text = text!([MyForm] "Waow it's my form! " [] "not anymore ðŸ˜¢");
//! ```
//!
//! In this example, I'm using the "MyForm" form in order to style the
//! text, while `[]` reverts back to the "Default" form. The
//! [`status!`] macro works similarly.
//!
//! Duat also has a simple command system, that lets you add commands
//! with arguments supported by Rust's type system:
//!
//! ```rust
//! # use duat::prelude::*;
//! # fn test() -> Result<(), Error<()>> {
//! let callers = ["collapse-command-line", "collapse-cmd"];
//! commands::add_for_widget::<CommandLine>(
//!     callers,
//!     |_command_line, area, _cursors, _flags, _args| {
//!         area.constrain_ver(Constraint::Length(0.0))?;
//!
//!         Ok(None)
//!     },
//! )
//! # }
//! ```
//!
//! The 2 arguments
//!
//! ## Roadmap
//!
//! These are the goals that have been acomplished or are on their
//! way:
//!
//! - [x] Implement basic visual functionality (printing, scrolling,
//!   etc);
//! - [x] Implement wrapping;
//! - [x] Implement editing;
//! - [x] Create a kak mode;
//! - [x] Implement the use of multiple cursors;
//! - [x] Implement a history system;
//! - [x] Implement colors;
//! - [x] Implement widgets and designated areas;
//! - [x] Make all of these things easy to use on a public interface;
//! - [x] Create a number line and a separator line;
//! - [x] Create a status line;
//! - [x] File switching;
//! - [x] Create a command creation interface and a command line;
//! - [x] Add the ability to frame areas;
//! - [x] Implement concealment;
//! - [x] Implement hot reloading of configuration;
//! - [x] Create a "normal editing" mode;
//! - [x] Add the ability to create hooks;
//! - [x] Create a more generalized plugin system;
//! - [x] Implement incremental Regex searching;
//! - [ ] Add floating widgets, not tied to the session layout;
//! - [ ] Implement autocompletion lists;
//! - [ ] Implement tree-sitter;
//! - [ ] Create an LSP plugin;
//! - [ ] Create a vim mode;
//!
//! ï¸™
//!
//! - [ ] Create an Iced frontend;
//!
//! __NOTE:__ These are not set in stone, and may be done out of
//! order.
//!
//! ## Why should I use this?
//!
//! I don't know what your personal reasoning would be, but in my
//! case, I really like Kakoune's editing model, but was frustrated
//! with the lack of some
//! features, like folding, multiple file editing, the general
//! barebonesness of the configuration, etc.
//!
//! I know that Neovim has all of these features, and Helix supposedly
//! tries to
//! solve some of these issues. But I don't really like either of
//! their editing
//! styles to be honest.
//!
//! And so I thought, why not make my own text editor?
//!
//! I thought, why not make a text editor that is as modular as
//! possible, while
//! still having a sensible default configuration? That I could modify
//! however I
//! wanted, and with a language that I love?
//!
//! That is why I decided to embark on this journey.
//!
//! ## Why the name
//!
//! idk, cool sounding word that I got from Spelunky 2.
//!
//! Also, just wanted to say that no AI was used in this project, cuz
//! I don't like it.
